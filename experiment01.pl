To study facts, objects, predicates and variables in PROLOG.

## Program

```prolog
student(bhavishya).
student(rahul).

likes(bhavishya, programming).
likes(rahul, ai).

age(bhavishya, 20).
age(rahul, 19).

Sample Query
?- student(bhavishya).
true.

?- student(X).
X = bhavishya ;
X = rahul.

?- age(bhavishya, X).
X = 20.
Result
Thus, facts, objects, predicates, and variables in PROLOG were studied successfully
